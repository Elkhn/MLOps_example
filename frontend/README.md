# SmartContractor

**Automated Contract Processing with AI-Powered Data Extraction**

---

## üìñ Overview

SmartContractor is an end-to-end solution designed to streamline contract processing by combining AI-driven data extraction with human oversight. The system automates the extraction of key contract details, validates accuracy through user interaction, and generates finalized PDFs‚Äîreducing manual effort while maintaining precision.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Document Classification**: Automatically identifies contract type.
- **LLM/NLP Data Extraction**: Extracts entities (company name, ID, dates, items, pricing).
- **User Validation Interface**: Confirm/Correct extracted data via web UI.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Editing**: Manual fixes when AI results need adjustment.
- **PDF Generation**: Produce downloadable/email-ready contracts.
- **Iterative Processing**: Cycles until user confirms all data is accurate.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The system consists of several key components that work together to automate and streamline the document extraction and validation process:

### Web Interface (UI)
- Users can upload vendor contract files through the web interface
- The UI provides a simple way for users to interact with the system

### File Storage Layer
- Uploaded files are temporarily stored in a file storage layer for further processing

### Document Classification Module
- The document classification module identifies the type of contract (e.g., vendor contract) based on the contents of the uploaded document

### Data Extraction (LLM/NLP)
This module uses a language model (LLM) and NLP techniques to extract key data from the contract, such as:
- Company Name
- Company ID
- Date, Item List
- Quantity, Price, and Total

### Confirmation from User
- The user is prompted to confirm the extracted data or request edits
- The system ensures the user can review the extracted details and make corrections if necessary

### Human in the Loop (if necessary)
- If the user requests edits, a human operator may manually fix the extracted data before the document is processed

### Final PDF Generation
- Once the data is confirmed, a PDF containing the extracted details is generated
- The user is given the option to download it or send it via email
